      <p>The seven wonders are the most remarkable architectural structures made by civilizations around the world. They are a proof
        of the architectural skills possessed by humans.

      <h4 id="2">History of the Seven Wonders</h4>

      <p>Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, to catalogue the world's
        most spectacular natural wonders and manmade structures. The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the first known list of the
      most remarkable creations of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and only includes
      works located around the Mediterranean
      rim and in Mesopotamia. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty,
      and because it was the number of the five planets known anciently, plus the sun and moon. Many similar lists have
      been made.</p>
